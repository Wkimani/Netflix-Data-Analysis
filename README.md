1. What is the comparison between the data types? / Understanding the content available.
2. Plotting the Tv shows & Movies vs ratings
3. Trend of the movies & Tv shows ratings in the past 10 years.
4. Number of Tv Shows & Movies released in the last 10 years.
5. Top 10 countries producing content

### Data Relevance
We check for data relevance by checking the percentage of missing values in the columns. If the percentage of missing values is greater than 30 %, we drop the column since it would already be missing quite a bit of information which would not be helpful in our data analysis. With our netflix data, none of the columns had missing values that were greater than 30 %, so we can say that our data is relevant.
